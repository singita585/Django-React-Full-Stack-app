I have created a frontend and backend project, the programming languages that i have used is Reactjs, python, SQL, css and choreo. In this project the user will enter the credentials in the 
login form to access their website, the website in question is the note app, where the user will create a note or list of things that they have to do, when they click save their note will be saved.
If they have no use of their note they can delete using the delete button. To see the codes download the zip file.
